GAIA DR3 BINARY ANALYZER DOCUMENTATION: THE RUWE RELIABILITY CHECK
------------------------------------------------------------------
This script performs a 3D distance analysis of a binary pair using 
Gaia DR3 parallaxes. However, it includes a critical safety check 
based on the RUWE (Renormalized Unit Weight Error) parameter.

WHAT IS RUWE?
RUWE is a 'goodness-of-fit' statistic for Gaia's astrometric solution.
- RUWE ~ 1.0: The star's movement perfectly matches a single-star model.
- RUWE > 1.4: The star is 'wobbling' or showing non-linear motion.

WHY THE CHECK IS NECESSARY (Per Tokovinin 2021, Sec 3.4):
In hierarchical systems (like STF 262), stars that appear to be 'single' 
components of a binary are often actually unresolved multiples 
(e.g., Aa,Ab or Ca,Cb). 

1. THE PARALLAX BIAS: When a star wobbles due to an inner companion, 
   Gaia's single-star mathematical model fails. It produces a 
   'biased' parallax measurement.
2. THE DISTANCE TRAP: A biased parallax results in an incorrect distance. 
   This often creates a 'ghost' distance gap of several parsecs, 
   making a physical pair look like an optical double.

HOW THE SCRIPT HANDLES THIS:
- If RUWE > 1.4 for either star, the script triggers a 'Tokovinin Alert'.
- It still performs the math but warns the user that the resulting 
  Verdict (Physical vs. Optical) is statistically UNRELIABLE.
- In these cases, a 'Verdict: Optical' should be ignored if other 
  evidence (like orbital history or proper motion) suggests a bond.
